## Project Objective:
The Polypathology Diagnosis Platform includes prediction models for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

1. **Prediction Model of Diabetes**: Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diabetes prediction and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
2. **Prediction Model of Heart Disease**: Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of heart disease prediction and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
3. **Prediction Model of Parkinson's Disease**: Develop a high accuracy and efficient machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual developing Parkinson's disease by considering demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. The goal is to provide an improved and more accurate prediction of Parkinson's disease, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes.
